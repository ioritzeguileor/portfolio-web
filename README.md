# portfolio-website
 ### my first website, created to familiarize myself with HTML,CSS and JS before diving deeper into some other JS Frameworks for my next project.
 
 ## https://ioritzeguileorcv.web.app
 
 the project section for my website is currently empty as I do not have any outstanding ones I would like to add, as time passes I will add them however I doubt this will be my portfolio for long
 
 note, theres a lot of junk file clutters that were added because of the firebase hosting, the main project files are the index.html and the assets folder
