# portfolio-website
 ### My first website, created to familiarize myself with HTML,CSS and JS before diving deeper into some other JS Frameworks for my next project.

 The project section for my website is currently empty as I do not have any outstanding ones I would like to add. As time passes I will add them. However I doubt this will be my portfolio for long

Note: theres a lot of junk file clutters that were added because of the firebase hosting. The main project files are the index.html and the assets folder.
